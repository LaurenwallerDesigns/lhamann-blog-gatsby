## How do you add local fonts to Gatsby?  
#### Hello
### ** Problem **  
After deploying my site on Netlify, I found that my fonts weren't working like I thought they would.  

** Why is this happening? **  
That was the question I needed to answer  

On other computers that didn't have the fonts preinstalled, they wouldn't show. It is a common problem but, I have never used local fonts for websites so, I had no idea what the solution would be.

*CMD + F*  

Find your font you would like to disable. 

Right-click the font you would like to disable.

Click on

```javascript

    resolve: "gatsby-plugin-web-font-loader",
        options: {
        custom: {
            families: [//your font family names],
            urls: ["/fonts/fonts.css"],
        },
    },
},
```  

Then I created a folder inside of src called static  
src/static/fonts/fonts.css  

This is where I messed up for *hours*  
I didn't know I was supposed to put a new static folder *inside* of src. Once I did that, I was able to
